# tabgrab
TabGrab is a JavaScript script that switches the favicon and page title of a website to grab the visitor's attention. It includes options to control the timeout and percentage of visitors who will not see a switch. The script uses dataLayer events to track when the switching has been initiated and when the visitor has returned to the tab.
